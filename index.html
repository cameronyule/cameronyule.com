	<h2>About</h2>

	<p>I’m a technical director and programmer based in London.</p>

	<p>I’ve planned, built and overseen many different types of projects, including websites, games, installations, mobile apps, ecommerce platforms, and technical operations and infrastructure.</p>

	<p>I’m comfortable learning new technologies and techniques as required. Tech that I’ve used and enjoyed recently includes JavaScript, WebGL, Ruby, Docker, ClojureScript, Unity, C#, and RaspberryPi.

	<p>I’ll be available for contract and consultancy work from July 2016.</p>
